=head1 NAME

Test::POE::Stopping - Test if a POE process has nothing left to do

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<POE> is a curious beast, as most asynchronous environments are.

But in regards to testing, one of the more interesting (and when it's not
working properly, annoying) situations is how to tell if the POE-controlled
process will, or has, stopped.

The obvious solution is to just say something like

  POE::Kernel->run;
  pass( "POE stopped" );

But this isn't really useful to us, because this test never fails, it just
deadlocks forever if some event generator is left around.

B<Test::POE::Stopped> takes an introspective method in determining this.

In your test script, a top level controlling session should be set up.

In this session, you should set a delayed alarm, that SHOULD fire after
everything is finished, and POE should have naturally stopped.

The delayed alarm will keep POE from returning, but it should make the alarm
the very last event called.

In this event you call the C<poe_stopping> function, which will examine the
running L<POE::Kernel> to see if it displays the characteristics of one
with the last event in progress (no other sessions, empty queue, no event
generators, etc).

If POE is B<not> stopping, then the C<poe_stopping> function will emit a
fail result and then do a hard-stop of the POE kernel so that at least your
test script ends.

=head2 poe_stopping

  poe_stopping();

The C<poe_stopping> test checks the kernel to see if, after the current
event, the POE kernel will have nothing else left to do and so will stop.
